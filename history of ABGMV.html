<h1 id"ab"> History of ABGMV.</h1>

<p> 
Akhil Bhartiya Gandarva Mahavidyalay (ABGMV) has started in 1901.<br>
It has started by <u>Pandit V.D Paluskar</u><br>
</p>
<h3>Early Beginnings (1901)</h3>

<p>
Pandit Vishnu Digambar Paluskar established the first Gandharva Vidyalaya (school) in<u> Lahore </u> on <u>May 5th, 1901.</u>
</p>

<h3>Shift to Bombay and Challenges (1907-1924)</h3>

<p>
In 1907, Paluskar moved to <u>Bombay</u> and set up another Gandharva Vidyalaya in <i>Girgaon</i> the following year.<br>
Despite initial success, the school faced financial and operational difficulties, leading to its closure in <u>1924.</u>

<h3>Carrying on Paluskar's Legacy (1931)</h3>

<p>
After Paluskar's passing in <u>1931,</u> his disciples decided to continue his mission of promoting music education.<br>
A meeting was held in <i>Ahmedabad</i> that year, where the Akhil Bharatiya Gandharva Mahavidyalaya Mandal (ABGMVM) was formally established.
</p>

<h3>Establishment of Affiliated Schools (1930s onwards)</h3>

<p>
Paluskar's students set up music schools, called <u>Gandharva Mahavidyalayas,</u> across <i>India.</i> <br>
These schools followed the curriculum developed by <u>ABGMVM</u> and students appeared for exams conducted by the board.<br>
The number of affiliated schools has steadily grown over the years.
</p>

<h3>ABGMVM Today</h3>

<p>
Today, ABGMVM is a leading organization for <u>Hindustani classical music</u> education in <i>India.</i> <br>
It has over <u>1200</u> affiliated institutions and conducts examinations for around<u> 100,000</u> students annually.
<br>
ABGMV played a crucial role in making Hindustani classical music education more accessible to the <u>middle class</u> in <i>India.</i><br>
It continues to be a significant institution in preserving and promoting this rich <u>musical tradition.</u>
